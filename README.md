# Arduino LED Control System
Basic Arduino project demonstrating LED control using digital output and timing functions in embedded C.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to understand the fundamentals of embedded systems,
microcontroller programming, and digital output control.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- LED
- Resistor (220Ω)
- Breadboard
- Jumper Wires

## Working Principle
The Arduino microcontroller sends a digital HIGH signal to the LED pin, turning it ON.
After a preset delay, the signal is set to LOW, turning the LED OFF.
This cycle repeats continuously.

## Circuit Diagram
A simple circuit was created using a resistor to limit current flow
and protect the LED.

## Code
The program is written in Embedded C using the Arduino IDE.
It uses basic digital I/O functions and delay timing.

## Results
- LED turns ON and OFF at programmed intervals
- Correct digital output control achieved

## Skills Gained
- Embedded C programming
- Arduino IDE usage
- Digital electronics basics
- Circuit building

## Future Improvements
- Add button control
- Implement PWM brightness control
